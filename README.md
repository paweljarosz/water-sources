# Water sources

Unofficial Defold Game Jam #2 submission

The game is based on my Defluid asset - fluid simulation. 

It is available to play [here on itch.io](https://paweljarosz.itch.io/water-sources)

The game's aim is to flood the logo of Defold with a water. You can do this by tapping/clicking on the screen to explode a bomb. You have limited amount of bombs. And each droplet is drying in a moment. Have fun while playing with simulated fluid!

Why the game is getting harder and harder?

Well,  in real world the water sources are drying really fast, oftentimes before soaking deep into the ground. Meanwhile, the underground water is a source of water for people. We can't treat it as an unlimited source. Due to global warming and increasing (at an alarming rate) consumption, sources are insufficient. Bear in mind this keynote, live and take care of lives! :)
